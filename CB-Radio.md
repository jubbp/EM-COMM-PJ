## CB Radio History in Australia

The following information was gathered from [https://radiorescue.org.au/cb-radio/cb-history/](https://web.archive.org/web/20240313112038/https://radiorescue.org.au/cb-radio/cb-history/)

### Pre-Legalisation

Citizens Band Radio (CB) was not legal in Australia until 1977, even though it
was gaining popularity in the USA where it was already legal. In the Australian
Senate on 1st December 1976, Senator Kilgariff directed a question to Senator
Carrick, representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, regarding
the plan to legalise CB in Australia, stating that there were some 25,000
Australians currently using CB that were unlicensed. In response, Sen. Carrick
said that estimates from the Department of Post and Telecommunications placed
the number of unlicensed CB operators in Australia at between 15,000 and 20,000,
and the one concern held at the time was the potential for interference to other
services.1

At this time there was no radiocommunications service available for personal
communications (Amateur Radio was intended for scientific and experimental use).
Various CB clubs, including the National Citizens Radio Association (NCRA),
Australian Citizens Radio Movement (ACRM, later to become Australian Citizen
Radio Monitors), Citizens Radio Emergency Service Teams (CREST), and numerous
truck drivers, all petitioned the Government from 1974 for the legalisation of
a CB service in Australia. A significant number of 23 channel 27MHz CB sets from
the USA had made their way into the Australian CB scene and were being used
illegally, given that the band was already in use by the Amateur Radio service.

### Legalisation

27MHz CB was formally legalised at a meeting of the National Cabinet on 2nd June
1977 where the Hon. Eric Robinson, Minister for Post and Telecommunications,
submitted that some 50,000 CB sets were currently being used illegally in
Australia. He submitted that the licensing of CB equipment in the HF band
(27MHz) be approved for a period of 3 years, and that the CB service be moved to
a UHF band after that. This was to allow current CB users to have a suitable
return on their investment in current CB equipment, and allow Australian
manufacturers time to equip themselves to make UHF CB equipment for the
Australian market. The licence fee was initially set at $20.2

Following this meeting CB was legalised as of 1st July 1977 using the existing
23 channel sets imported from the USA (26.965-27.245MHz), although an Australian
18 channel standard (27.015-27.225MHz), along with UHF, was introduced on 1st
January 1978 under RB249. Licensing was under the Handphone option of the
Wireless Telegraphy Act and Regulations. The allocation of a channel designated
for emergencies (channel 5 on both 27MHz 18ch and UHF bands) only came after
the initial legalisation and was disclosed in a question to the Minister for
Post and Telecommunications during the 31st Parliament on 3rd April 1979.
Although this question was posed from the viewpoint of a channel for CREST, the
Minister recognised that a number of volunteer groups provided emergency monitoring.3

### End of 27MHz

The cut-off date for the 27MHz band was set as 30th June 1982, with 21 days for
27MHz operators to cease transmissions on this band. As the 1982 deadline for
the complete transfer of CB to the UHF band approached, users of the 27MHz CB
equipment rallied to keep the band alive. CB groups protested against the
removal of the 27MHz band. Motorcades were run in every major city and petitions
were lodged with the Government. These petitions also called for an expansion of
the 27MHz band to 40 channels, mirroring the USA band 26.965-27.405MHz, and
retention of the dual-band 27MHz and UHF CB service.4, 5, 6, 7, 8

These petitions and protests were successful, and the Government not only
removed the “use by” date for 27MHz but expanded the service to the 40 channels
it still has today. While fees changed over time, initially “per radio”, then
“up to 5 radios”, the need to obtain an individual licence for your CB station
continued until 3rd October 1994 when the Citizen Band Radio Stations Class
Licence was introduced (announced by Roger Smith, Acting Spectrum Manager,
Spectrum Management Agency).9 This removed the need for CB users to apply for a
licence and pay an annual fee, but it did not remove any of the legal channel
designations or conditions of use that had previously appeared in the RB14/DOC14
documents.

### CB Today

Today, the CB service in Australia continues as a dual-band service with 40
channels between 26.965 and 27.405MHz (AM/SSB, 10kHz steps) and 80 channels
between 476.4250 and 477.4125MHz (FM, 12.5kHz steps). While the 27MHz band is
the same as that used in the USA and several European CEPT countries, the UHF
band is unique to Australia and New Zealand. All CB equipment must also comply
with Australian/New Zealand Standards and be approved for use on the CB bands
with either the Regulatory Compliance Mark (RCM), or the older C-Tick (also
known as “type-approved”). It should be noted that many people incorrectly
believe all UHF commercial equipment approved for use on the Land Mobile
Service (LMS) can be used on UHF CB. In fact, not all LMS equipment is
dual-approved for use on LMS and CB services.
