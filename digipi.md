## Introduction

I first found the Digipi Project in late 2022 and immediately became a
patreon supporter. The project seemed very interesting to me  and allowed me to
get introduced to digital modes as a fledgling operator.

## Download DigiPi

Digipi is only available as a rasberry pi image to patreons on the project.
