APRS is digital communications information channel for Ham radio. As a single
national channel (see map at right), it gives the mobile ham a place to monitor
for 10 to 30 minutes in any area, at any time to capture what is happening in
ham radio in the surrounding area. Announcements, Bulletins, Messages, Alerts,
Weather, and of course a map of all this activity including objects,
frequencies, satellites, nets, meetings, Hamfests, etc.
