## PACE Plan

## GhostNet Protocol

The GhostNet is a communications protocol for use as needed in a grid down and
even into a time of war. It is a protocol which is designed to allow communication
during times of trouble. The complete GHOSTNet protocol is a little over the top
but I have pulled out the essentials which will allow communications among fellow
participants.

### GhostNet Preparation

The GhostNext indicates a regular net on Thursday Evenings
