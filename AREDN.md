## Introduction

AREDN or Amateur Radio Emergency Data network is a world wide WIFI (ish) network
run by amateurs alongside other technoilogies to provide network when other
options are failing.

[www.arednmesh.org](www.arednmesh.org)

## Why AREDN?

Why Not just use standard WIFI?

- Auto network configuration
- Mesh Network - Self Healing

## The DownSides

- No Encryption Allowed
  - Even the Web Tunnels as not encrypted
  - You must not allow encrypted web traffic to pass through your nodes
- Limited hardware selection
  
## How To's

### How do I get my node on the map

You've worked your way through the setup of an AREDN node and eagerly jump over
the the website to check if your node is on the map. Only to find that there's
nothing there.

The following must be done to show on the map.

- You must enter your lat and log into the node interface.
- You must link to the greater AREDN network in some way. This ia probably
  going to be by a tunnel or by and RF link if you are lucky enough to have one nearby.

### How to I organise a tunnel for my node

There isn't really a list of people who you can connect with. There are forums
around the net where people ask for tunnel servers looking for new connections.

If you can;t find a Ham on onf the many forums, you can try the second idea I
did. I took a look at the mesh map on arednmesh.org and found a node with some
established tunnel connections. I then looke up the Callsign and snet and email
to the address I found on QRZ.com

Most Hams are nice people and will assist if they can.

Once a agreement to connect is establlished, the server end will send you the
client details to insert into your node.

## What can we do on ARDEN networks

As AREDN is a high bandwidth network based on WIFI, there are endless
possibilities for solutions that can be implemented.

### Web Sites

### MeshChat

Resilient chat communications

### VOIP Telephone services

PBX based on direct IP calling
