## Introduction
This document is my work to investigate and document an emcomms methodology.

### What is EmComm?
EmComm is short for Emergency Communications. It is a procedure/method of maintaining reliable and effective communications during an emergency. An EmComm system should help in the collection, collation and distribution of information during an emergency situation where mainstream communications maybe disrupted. 

EmComm should not be about any one particular technology or mode of communication, but should be about the communication itself.

### Why do we need EmComm?
In the event of a disruption to normal life, communication is a vital resource for all. This is where EmComm and Amateur Radio Operators can step up to assist the community.

### Who may need our assitance.
There are many who may need our assistance. They are probably not those that your might hink of first.
In Western Australia, the emergency services are served by an extensive communication network whihc is multi-redundant and resilient. See the section of [Emergecy Services Radio resources](./README#emergency-services-radio).
