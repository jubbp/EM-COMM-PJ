# Emcomm Notes by Phil VK6DEV
## Introduction
This document is my work to investigate and document an emcomms methodology. 

### What is EmComm?

An EmComm system should help in the collection, collation and distribution of information during an emergency situation where mainstream communications maybe disrupted.
